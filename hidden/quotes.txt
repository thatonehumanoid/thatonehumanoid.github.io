I don't usually ask for anyone's help. But when I do, that when you know it's bad.

I yell because I care. I know you can do better. You should worry when I stop yelling, because that means I have given up on you.

When you see someone that needs help there’s only two options for who’s gonna help them. You or no one. If you believe that you don’t have to help since someone else will, then what stops others from thinking the same until not a single person helps. If everyone chooses to wait instead of helping, who’s gonna save the person ready to jump into the road this afternoon?

Who am I? What am I? What should I do? What’s my name? Who’s the correct person? What is my problem? Who should go away?
I have no idea.
