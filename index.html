    Yay, my website is now built and hosted. Decided to make it look scrapbook, notebook-ish. Its URL is thatonehumanoid.github.io. I'm excited to keep this going. I'll figure out how to add pictures later. Shouldn't be too hard, it's just HTML. If some of this sounds weird or out of chronological order thats because I'm keeping a physical notebook as well.

      First time journaling or writing a diary entry. Whatever works. Hopefully I'll make this a habit. And get better handwriting. I'll probably have longer entries and short burst entries. A sentence desribing something, a feeling, an object, etc. I think a website would be cool. I'd post my stuff there. I'll do that tomorrow.

      const h1Text = h1.textContent || h1.innerText;
      const regex = /\b\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\b/; // Regex to match yyyy-mm-dd format
      const match = h1Text.match(regex);
