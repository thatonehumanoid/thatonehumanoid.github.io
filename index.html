Vulnerable, nice, polite, the textbook prince of perfection. The second one is who I can be if I want to, ruthless, apathetic, cunning. Its fun being able to switch and use their skills. But honestly the second ones gotta die off.

  I think that I prefer to stay quiet and not speak so I have no chance to hurt my friends or myself. So in conclusion, this journal is good for me according to my main friend group's designated therapist(me).

  I know that there are plenty of people who have it worse than me, I wonâ€™t ever say that Iâ€™m in the worst condition there is. But what I will say is I have the hope that I can bring those in a deeper pit than me, out of those pits.

  I believe that I look, smell, sound, etc. like the worst person alive, in return, no one can hurt me when they call me names. No one has ever hurt me, since no one can hate me more than I can.

  Not being able to love is hard. For some context I just can't feel attraction, I have no idea how attraction feels, or how it works. So I'm constantly in a state of paranoia over it. Just like this: <br>
  <br>
  â€¢ I say something<br>
  â€¢ They say something a little teasy/textbook flirting stuff<br>
  â€¢ I think I said something flirty aswell<br>
  â€¢ Absolute terror of if I just said something I might not have wanted too.<br>
  <br>
  I'm led to constantly second-guess everything I say. I'm also bad at getting any and all clues and/or social cues. They can say something so flirty and teasing and I just won't notice.<br>
  <br>
  I wish I could get the cues, it would make life so much easier. And at the same time, harder, I would have to deal with conflicting emotions more than I already am.

  Oh the pressure, the pressure to be perfect. Every single thing you do needs to be perfect and spot on...<br>
<br>
...or else...<br>
<br>
It's always, "Get and A," "Be the top of your class", "You can do this!", "You can do better than that!", "Why can't you be as good as you where last trimester?", "You never try your hardest and thats why you are failing.", "IF I SEE A SINGLE 'F' I WILL...", "If you don't do your homework(English, math, chemistry, AP classes) and chores you're grounded! Also watch your siblings, I'm going to take a nap."<br>
<br>
I know I should respect my parents and the work they have done to give me the life I have. But my own sanity is not an equal trade.<br>
<br>
Its day like this that I'm glad my mother lost her voice.

Lunch was fun. I got to listen to music with one of my friends. One person sitting nearby came up to me after the lunch bell and said, "You two would make a cute couple."<br>
<br>
The stranger's friend then replied, "Thats gay."

  When you see someone that needs help thereâ€™s only two options for whoâ€™s gonna help them. You or no one. If you believe that you donâ€™t have to help since someone else will, then what stops others from thinking the same until not a single person helps. If everyone chooses to wait instead of helping, whoâ€™s gonna save the person ready to jump into the road this afternoon?

   I find myself drawn to only writing in my diary/journal digitally. Transcribing from physical to digital and vice versa has become an unwelcome task. I can also type words down much faster than I can write.
   <br>
   <br>
   On that note, I researched the difference between a diary and a journal. A diary is a factual record of daily events, while a journal is for reflection and exploration of thoughts and emotions. So this record would be more of a journal than a diary.

    Yay, my website is now built and hosted. Decided to make it look scrapbook, notebook-ish. Its URL is thatonehumanoid.github.io. I'm excited to keep this going. I'll figure out how to add pictures later. Shouldn't be too hard, it's just HTML. If some of this sounds weird or out of chronological order thats because I'm keeping a physical notebook as well.

      First time journaling or writing a diary entry. Whatever works. Hopefully I'll make this a habit. And get better handwriting. I'll probably have longer entries and short burst entries. A sentence desribing something, a feeling, an object, etc. I think a website would be cool. I'd post my stuff there. I'll do that tomorrow.
