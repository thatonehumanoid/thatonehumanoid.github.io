    I don't know what to do anymore. I want to tell my best friend about what I've done and for him to accept me. But I feel as if what I did was to great for forgiveness or any scrap of empathy. The longer I hide it the deeper I dig my grave, but I can't make myself come out and say it.<br><br>I'm scared, I'm tired, I'm hurting, and I can't see a path forward that ends well for everyone involved.

    I slept weird last night and did something to my back. It hurts to stand, sit, walk, anything that needs my back. But even though I feel like I'm dying, I must continue to do what I have to. I have to do everything, and no matter what, convince people it's easy for me, so I don't disappoint anyone with my lack of skills. Keeping up the act is driving me insane. Both the acts of keeping my problems hidden and not letting anyone find out the truth behind this journal.<br><br>No one can know.<br><br>It would kill their faith in me.<br><br>It would kill me.

    If my friends find out about what I did, I have no idea how they will react. I can only assume that I would lose them since I broke their trust and tricked them. It'll just be like going back a couple of years to when I barely even talked with my best friend. He's a caring and understanding person but with what I've done I can't be so sure that he won't stay like that. He has every reason to absolutely detest and hate me. I have no exuse for what I did and everyone has the right to hate me.

The pain from self-inflicted injuries feels different any pain inflicted by others. The difference between being forced to feel pain versus the  <em style="font-size: 25px;"><strong>want</strong></em> to feel that pain. It's freeing, like I can finally choose what I want instead of it being chose for me. Just like any other injury, it hurts, but not as much as it hurts to, for example, have a box-cutter slip and cut yourself suddenly.

  Well, to anyone that is reading this, forget about the scavenger hunt thing. That was just a stupid attempt to get people to stay and read my narcissistic and self-absorbed problems. And because of that, I'm sorry. Sorry for making my problems seem bigger than they are. Sorry for having to read this sad excuse for my life. Sorry for ever making you worried about me.

<a href="https://github.com/thatonehumanoid/thatonehumanoid.github.io/discussions/new?category=general">Discussions</a> 
<br><br>
Then if I can find the time too, I'll post a second location, this time with something physically there. A paper with a encrypted message, a QR code, link, etc.
<br><br>
So here is the first image, good luck.

  I don't fear death, I fear what I would leave behind. I fear that I if I die early I would be leaving all my friends and the people that rely on me in a hard spot. I wouldn't be there to help them with their problems, to talk with them when they need it most. I would be abandoning them without knowing if they could continue on without me. 
  <br><br>
  Thats why even through all the muck the world throws up I will push forwards, never for personal gain, always for others until the day I can finally rest in peace knowing I've helping every last person I could.

    Update on the previous post, nothing has gotten better, in fact probably worse. My average asleep time goes from 03:30 to 06:00. I just can't sleep. Even melatonin won't help me.
    <br>
    <br>
    Even worse news. I was shaving my legs and cut myself. Not like a little nick or scratch, but a half-inch long cut. It bled for awhile and hurt like heck. But it felt really good, the pain was intoxicating, like a drug, it felt good. I'm sure you can see where this is going.

    Christmas break and my family really threw a wrench into me writing here. But I'm back now so its ranting time. So first some statistics, in 2024 over 106,000 lives were lost to suicide globally. And I say over because many countries, states, territories, etc. try to downplay how bad it is. And every death  has yet to be recorded and published in charts. <br><br> 
On a different note, its finally 2025, let's hope for the best. My new years resolution is too stop being a terrible friend that guilt trips and lies to get what I want. But do I really do those things? Kinda hard to figure that out with imposter syndrome. But I might not have that either, and according to Dr. Internet doubting having imposter syndrome is a sign of having it. Very fun. <br><br>
Now for the more serious stuff. My insomnia has gotten to its highest it's ever been and doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon. Winter depression is making its rounds again, hopefully not for long. I can tell I'm not doing good with stress and my mental health since even though I take daily showers and have a pretty good routine I still have bad breath and body odor. I have so many people I can talk too at a moments notice but I still feel, alone. Even my bestfriend since forever is drifting away from me, my bff, my longest friendship, my partner in crime, my go to for advice. If he goes I will quite literally have no one I can trust. Back to insomnia, the only way I've been able to sleep is particularly funny to me during typing this out. I listen to some depression comfort asmr and cry myself to sleep. I know, I know, just hilarious isn't it? After committing this that's what I'll be doing.<br><br>

  I was once asked what the most terrifying monster is. I couldn't find a good enough answer for that moment. Skeletons, zombies, SCPs, ghosts, giants, leviathans, Cthulhu, etc. We usually visualize a monster based on the common definition. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines a monster as, “An animal of strange or terrifying shape, a mythical monster, a sea monster.” But there are more than looks that make something a monster.
<br><br>
I now know that answer to this question. The majority of the deadliest disasters and horrors were caused by this monster race. They can take extreme damage, lose half their blood and still live on. They have survived multiple close calls with extinction and then doubled past their original population. Anything that crossed its path either had to move aside or be destroyed. They are so persistent and efficient that any prey they chase ends up giving up out of exhaustion. They kill their own kind based on petty biased reasoning. They drove at least 150,000 to 260,000 of all known species to extinction. Their own advancement caused their own ecosystem to decay and die.

  Not being able to love is hard. For some context I just can't feel attraction, I have no idea how attraction feels, or how it works. So I'm constantly in a state of paranoia over it. Just like this: <br>
  <br>
  • I say something<br>
  • They say something a little teasing/textbook flirting stuff<br>
  • I think I said something flirty as well<br>
  • Absolute terror of if I just said something I might not have wanted too.<br>
  <br>
  I'm led to constantly second-guess everything I say. I'm also bad at getting any and all clues and/or social cues. They can say something so flirty and teasing and I just won't notice.<br>
  <br>
  I wish I could get the cues, it would make life so much easier. And at the same time, harder, I would have to deal with conflicting emotions more than I already am.

It's always, "Get and A," "Be the top of your class", "You can do this!", "You can do better than that!", "Why can't you be as good as you where last trimester?", "You never try your hardest and thats why you are failing.", "IF I SEE A SINGLE 'F' I WILL...", "If you don't do your homework(English, math, chemistry, AP classes) and chores you're grounded!

   I find myself drawn to only writing in my diary/journal digitally. Transcribing from physical to digital and vice versa has become an unwelcome task. I can also type words down much faster than I can write.
   <br>

   On that note, I researched the difference between a diary and a journal. A diary is a factual record of daily events, while a journal is for reflection and exploration of thoughts and emotions. So this record would be more of a journal than a diary.
