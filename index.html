  Lunch was fun. I got to listen to music with one of my friends. One person sitting nearby came up to me after the lunch bell and said, "You two would make a cute couple."<br>
  <br>
  The stranger's friend then replied, "Thats gay."

  When you see someone that needs help there’s only two options for who’s gonna help them. You or no one. If you believe that you don’t have to help since someone else will, then what stops others from thinking the same until not a single person helps. If everyone chooses to wait instead of helping, who’s gonna save the person ready to jump into the road this afternoon?

   I find myself drawn to only writing in my diary/journal digitally. Transcribing from physical to digital and vice versa has become an unwelcome task. I can also type words down much faster than I can write.
   <br>
   <br>
   On that note, I researched the difference between a diary and a journal. A diary is a factual record of daily events, while a journal is for reflection and exploration of thoughts and emotions. So this record would be more of a journal than a diary.

    <h4>Like throwing a rock into the ocean.</h4>
    <h5>But did you even stop to think,</h5>
    <h6>How deep the rock could go?</h6>

    Yay, my website is now built and hosted. Decided to make it look scrapbook, notebook-ish. Its URL is thatonehumanoid.github.io. I'm excited to keep this going. I'll figure out how to add pictures later. Shouldn't be too hard, it's just HTML. If some of this sounds weird or out of chronological order thats because I'm keeping a physical notebook as well.

      First time journaling or writing a diary entry. Whatever works. Hopefully I'll make this a habit. And get better handwriting. I'll probably have longer entries and short burst entries. A sentence desribing something, a feeling, an object, etc. I think a website would be cool. I'd post my stuff there. I'll do that tomorrow.
